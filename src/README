This program is a utility to gather the rendered frames from the separate
machines in the cluster, as defined in the given JSON configuration file.
This is the final part of the utilities for my own render queue.

It requires the libcJSON and libssh libraries to be installed in a manner
that the linker can find it.

This program is written in C, and requires an appropriate C compiler.
